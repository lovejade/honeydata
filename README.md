## Honeydata â€” honey encryption library (work in progress)
[Honey encryption] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Encryption) is a novel type of data encryption. This library provides honey encryption primitives for certain types of numeric data. This is work in progress now, so don't expect any backward compatibility! Licence: [BSD 2-clause] (http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) with public domain parts.
